# Autism Detection
## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation code for the paper:  
**Towards the Development of Explainable Machine Learning Models to Recognize the Faces of Autistic Children**

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from various data sources. The goal is to build accurate and interpretable models that can assist in early diagnosis.

**Dataset**

The dataset can be accessed from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/123978)

**Test the model**

To run the test script:
```bash
python test.py
```

**Train the model**

To run the train script, you need to first change the values in the config.py, and then run the following script:
```bash
python train.py
```

**Use Explainability**

To run the explainability, you need to run the following script:
```bash
python explainability.py
```
